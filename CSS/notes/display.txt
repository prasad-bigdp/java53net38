Display : display is used to arrange the elements. block elements always appears iin new line. inline elements always continues in same line but we can change this using display property
   display :block --> make the element block
   display:inline --> make the element inline
   display:inline-block --> make the element inline-block(it is similar to inline but also contains height & width)
   display: none ---> disappears the element (visibility:hidden also disappears the elements it holds the space)

Apply the flex properties to parents
  Parent properties:
     display:flex --> it automatically arranges child items into row direction
     flex-direction: row/column/row-reverse/column-reverse;
     The direction in which items are adjusted is called main axis and opposite one is called cross axis
     justify-content:left/right/start/end/center/space-between/space-evenly/space-around
     it adjusts the child items around main axis
     align-items : left/start/right/end/center
     gap : it is used to provide gap between the items
     flex-wrap: nowrap/wrap/wrap-reverse; it is used to arrange elements in multiple rows/columns
     align-content :left/right/start/end/center/space-between/space-evenly/space-around
     it is used to adjust gap between the rows/columns
