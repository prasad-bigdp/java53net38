CSS : cascading styled sheets started in 1994 to provide style/design to the web pages. It also provides layout and makes the website more interactive and user friendly
CSS contains Properties with values specified for a selector
   selector 
   {
      Property:value,............
   }
There are three types of CSS :
   i. Internal Styling/CSS : it is used to provide CSS within 'style' element
    <style>
       CSS CODE HERE
    </style>

   ii. Inline Styling/CSS : it is used to provide CSS within HTML element as 'style' attribute
   <element style="CSS CODE"></element>

   iii. External Styling/CSS : it is used to Provide CSS in an external file and attach it to HTML file using link tag

   CSS Follows Priority Such as !important > Inline >Internal=External.
   Between Internal and External, the one which comes later cascades the previous one

   selectors : selectors are used to select an element. Basic CSS Selectors are
   i. tagname:  we can select all the elements of specific tag using tagname selector
   ii. class : we can select HTML elements using an attribute class. Multiple element may contain same class name or single element may contain multiple class names. we can select class by symbol dot(.classname)
   iii. id : we can select any HTML element using an attribute ID. ID's are unique for a HTML element. we can select id by symbol hash(#id).
