Box Model : It is considered as "the heart of CSS". it is fundamental topic of design
Box Model contains 4 properties
  i. border : defines the border of element
        border:width type color;
    type can be solid/dashed/dotted/groove/double
    color is by default text color
    we can also provide border-left,border-right,border-top,border-bottom

  ii. border-radius : defines the corner radius of element's border. 50% of border radius can make circle for square elements
       border-radius: width or %;
    we can also provide border-top-left-radius, border-top-right-radius etc..,
  iii. padding : it is the space between border and content of element(inside).padding might increase actual height/width of element. To solve this, we can use "box-sizing:border-box"
   padding:size; it applies padding to all sides
   padding : top-bottom left-right;
   padding: top left-right bottom;
   padding: top right bottom left;

   iv. margin : it is the gap outside the border. 
   it is similar to padding.
   margin: width;
   * margin:auto can make element center horizontally in its width

Different units in CSS: In CSS we can define sizes in different units such as
  i. px(pixels) :  it is smallest units like a dot that fills height and width of screen resolution
  ii. vh/vw : vh stands for viewport height and vw stands for viewport width. it is the % of total screen height/width
  iii. percentage(%) : percentage is used to get x% of parents properties. if child contains height:50% , means it is 50% of parents height
  iv. em(enumerated value) : it is used to make all child property depends on single parent property(Font-size)
      1em stands 1 time of parents font size

      we can also use rem which is root enumerated values. its values depends on body font size
      1rem stands for 1 time of body's font size


 Float : Float is used to arrange the elements either left or right , but the next element might occupy the space surrounded by the floating element
     float:left/right/none

  To clear the Float, you can use clear:left/right/both/none;
