Position in CSS : it is used to specify where exactly the elements need to be positioned.
There are 5 positions available in CSS
i. static: static is the default position for every element. it won't have any impact of top,left,right,bottom. so, we cannot move this.
ii. Relative : Relative is used to move the element from its current position. it used top,left,right,bottom to provide the gaps/to move
   position:Relative;
   left:100px;
   top:100px;
   moves the element with gap left and top 100px each

iii. absolute: absolute is used to move the element based on body . 
    position:absolute;
    right:0;
    bottom:0;
    moves the element bottom right corner. but it is scrollable
iv. fixed : fixed is used to move the element based on body but scrolling will not have effect on this
    position:fixed;
    right:0;
    bottom:0;
    makes the element fixed always at bottom right corner
v. sticky : sticky is similar to fixed but it initially follows relative. it stays as relative until position met its values and stays fixed until the parent container is over
   position:sticky;
   top:0;
   makes the element fixed when it reaches top:0
